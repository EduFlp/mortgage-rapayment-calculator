OVERVIEW
I had a lot of difficulty doing this project because I'm an amateur and this a project for junior programmers.
Obviously, there are mistakes there that I made because I didn't have much time to develop this project better.
I started it in 2024, but my college classes came back and I didn't have time to improve it anymore. So, even thoguh
this is my first time doing something like this, I know I cand do better and I will do better in the future.
Anyway, the project was very complex and very extensive to be done. Despite my efforts to remember concepts from CSS
and Java, I had to seek help on YouTube. Additionally, this was my first time using SCSS.

THE CHALLENGE
- Input mortgage information and see monthly repayment and total repayment amounts after submitting the form
- See form validation messages if any field is incomplete
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

MY PROCESS
My process was very difficult, as I didn't have much time to develop the site due to my college chores. In addition, I had
never worked with SCSS before, so everything was very new to me.

BUILT WITH
- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- SCSS
- JAVASCRIPT

CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT
Now that I've descovered a new tool (SCSS), it takes more and more practice to become a good programmer, I'll try to remember
my CSS and JS studies to improve my future code.
